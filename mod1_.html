                        using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web

                             <p> <h3>MY INITIAL POST</h3></p> 
                              <p> Cybercrime has propagated not just affected individual companies but has turned into a societal (global) menace. For example, in April 2021the ransomware attack of the colonial pipeline affected energy availability on the East Coast of the United States, creating disorder and confusion. As gasoline shortages directly impact most Ameri-cans, this attack hit close to homes. Safety rules were ignored as residents hoarded petroleum products( inflammable) in plastic bags and bins; one car even caught fire. In addition, the ransomware targeted the billing system, and the internal business network, leading to widespread shortages in multiple states.  Colonial Pipeline even-tually paid the ransom of 4.4 million dollars in bitcoin (Illinois, 2021). 
                              Cyber-attacks cause companies very high reputation damage causing them to lose customers to their competitors because of loss of trust. It has been discovered that about 6%of companies affected by ransomware have paid ransom to regain control of their critical infrastructure. Businesses that come under cyber attack also incur higher costs from operational disruption and altered business practices. In addition, compa-nies that have experienced data breaches have paid millions to settle claims because of the obligation they owe to the customers to protect the information they collect ac-cording to laws like the GDPR.
                              “According to business insurers, Hiscox Companies lost $1.8 billion to cybercrime in 2019 as a result of litigation” (Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report 2019, 2019).
                              Cybersecurity is not just critical to reducing the cost on companies when there is a breach; it also can cause chaos in society when necessary facilities are affected.</p><br>

                              <p>1.In conjunction with these points, which you have highlighted,  the importance of cyber security in our society, small and large companies is enormous.
                                   A good and comprehensive cyber security will protect the business and assure the employees that they are safe to work, resulting in the company's growth and society in general. 
                                   One of the most valuable commodities in the digital age is personal information. If intruders can obtain personal information regarding your employees or customers, they are quite capable of selling that information or even using it for monetary gain.
                                   Efficient cyber security will cause the productivity of a business to increase; as we all know, the attack on a system that has a virus will slow down the system to an almost impossible rate to work. Adware in the form of a virus can be so annoying and slow down the productivity of an enterprise and can lead to the point of entry for malicious activities.
                                   The BBC reports that the outage of the Facebook website due to configuration cost Facebook more than $6bn (£4.4bn), with its shares dropping nearly 5%. This was only in some hours of disruption. Attacks on any website cost the business lots of money, reputational damage, and even the risk of bankruptcy.
                                   Trust in a business is one of the most critical factors that drive the growth and sustainability of the business. Once a company has a good reputation that its security is guaranteed and their privacy and data are in good hands, the public will eventually build trust in that company, and so will the growth of the business.
                                   The importance of cybersecurity today is vital for the growth and proper functioning of any enterprise and organisation. It also creates jobs for humanity</p>

                                  <p> It is often complicated to apportion an adequate amount of security to an asset; this makes the problem of securing an asset more cumbersome. Before the ages of recent digitalisation, it was that simple that data were stored in cabinets and required just physical security to keep them safe. Still, now it is not just physical security needed to secure the file server or the computer. There is also the need to have a cryptographer to encrypt passwords, well-trained personnel to handle and configure the system so it won’t have vulnerabilities, a monitoring system to detect intruders etc. All these have made the security of the systems and cybercrime prevention more difficult, especially for small companies.</p>
                                   Cybercrimes are often carried out with the attacker in a different location from where the crime is being perpetuated is another difficult challenge to cyberspace security.<br>

                                To add to your insight, the complexity of cybersecurity is complicating the security of cyberspace. Cyber-attack can be attributed to technical, legal, and political aspects. The technical side identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet level has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyber-attacks to individual perpetrators, especially to states that direct the attacks, is complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues.
                                Legal issues surrounding the attribution of state-sponsored cyber-attacks have received comparatively little attention. A significant reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non–cyber specific international law. This has made the cyber fight against actors more complicated and persistent in society.
                                Although all these challenges exist, the fight and importance of cyber security are still vital to the sustainability of business and societal growth. Thus, it has become a societal problem that needs to be addressed both by the company and the government.

                                To add a little to the importance of cyber security in the health sector.
                                As a result of the Covid 19 pandemic, the cyberattack has increased dramatically, affecting the health care sector, as the world health organisation alerted. The number of cyberattacks is now more than five times what it used to be before the pandemic endangering the health care industry revealing a considerable risk for health processes. However, this risk comes from people actions, technology failure that results from cyber-attacks.
                                Some healthcare providers use IoT applications to provide critical medical services such as embedded context prediction, embedded gateway configuration; indirect emergency treatment; semantic medical access; wearable device access; health information regarding children, community healthcare, and adverse drug reactions. Beneficiaries can receive these services using various medical IoT applications, such as healthcare solutions that use smartphones, wheelchair and medication management, rehabilitation systems, and systems to monitor oxygen saturation, body temperature, blood pressure and electrocardiograms; and sensing blood glucose level. These IoT applications can reduce medical services’ costs, improve the users’ experiences and serve more patients with the limited availability of healthcare resources. (WIRED Staff, 2011) However, the attack on this IOT product will hamper and significantly affect primary health care services delivery. Therefore, the importance of cybersecurity can never be overemphasised as much and greater need for the proper security of these IoT appliances.

                            <p> <h6><b>MY SUMMARY POST </b></h6></p> 
            <p>In the initial post, Tolofari, S. (2021) related how cyberattacks could significantly affect society causing chaos and substantial financial and reputational loss to companies. A breach probably affects a company's infrastructure, like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that affected energy availability and compromised the personal information of nearly 6,000 individuals, creating disorder, confusion, and property loss(Business, 2021). According to Danialou, M.(2021), on the peer response, we are already amid a "cyber pandemic" with the number of attacks on critical infrastructures rising sharply.
            It was also Highlighted that inadequate cyber security has led to substantial economic loss to companies through litigation and fines over data breaches and violations. For example, laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Intersoft Consulting, 2018) fined British Airways through the UK's data protection authority after customer data leakage due to poor data security. Equifax incurred almost 148 million due to compromised data records (Johnson, 2021). DigiNotar, a certificate authority, went bankrupt due to the control of all eight of the company's certificate-issuing servers pinpointing the unwavering need for cyber security (Fisher, D 2012).
             The effect of cybercrime on healthcare industries in the initial post, Okafor-Tolofari, I. (2021), was extensively discussed. An example was the WannaCry Ransomware that cost the NHS £92 million in recovery. The evolution of medicine significantly depends on IoT devices to provide critical medical services. A cyber-attack that affects these facilities will result in the loss of life and jeopardy in society.
            The covid pandemic that hit the world, as agreed with Jurbe. in the peer response, has changed the way we work, with remote work and studies being the solution and an alternative to the pandemic (Jubet, 2021). Imagine a disruption of cyber activities, what catastrophe and chaos it will cause the world's economy, and its imbalance to society.
            The need for having well-trained and staffed cybersecurity professionals in business, government agencies cannot be overemphasised. A lack of it will significantly affect the business economically, cause reputational loss, and create a volatile society.</p></br>

                <h4> AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION; AN ESSENTIAL FOR NETWORK AND SOFTWARE SECURITY.</h4>

                <p> Security is a crucial part of any application or environment (Bullock and Benford, 1999) and granting access to these secured applications and the environment needs to be controlled; who gets access to what? What are the rules? How is it tracked? These are managed through an access control system providing access to restricted areas of the business (SailPoint, 2021).” Access control is governed according to the space within which subjects and objects reside, and the ability to traverse space to get close to an object” by Bullock and Benford, 1999. Who(subject) gets access to resources(object) is validated through authentication and authorisation processes.</p>

<p>Authentication, verifying who someone is, has long passed username and passwords to more advanced Artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies. The application of multi-factor authentication verifying an individual identity based on two to three different parameters, something you (have, know and are) works based on artificial intelligence and deep learning, where data, logs, transactions, and real-time communications are analysed to detect an intruder (Okta, 2018).</p>

<p>Hardware embedded chips are evolving technologies that authenticate users using multiple levels and methods. An example is the sixth generation vPro Chips by intel (IFF Lab, 2019).</p>

<p> Authorisation is to which asset one has permission to access through settings supported by security teams (Okta, 2018). The more often used to perform these authorisation processes include Role-Based Access Control, Discretionary based access control, Attribute-based access control, Rule-Based Access Control. These strategies help application developers control the access to the resources depending on the applied method and to what level the user is permitted.</p>

<p>Authentication and authorisation are vital in access control management, verifying a user’s identity effectively, thus allowing authenticated users to access protected resources depending on the given authority level; these ensure that security is maintained both in the network and the software to be accessed (Wang, Bo and Zhang, 2013).</p>

       <p><b>Peer review on AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORISATION</b></p>

       <p>Samuel, thanks for this interesting post on authentication and authorisation.

        To add some insight.
        
        Authentication and authorisation are multi-deployment security system that plays an essential role in securing systems, confirming identities and granting access. authentication and authorisation are two of the most critical aspects of system control because providing a secure environment on the internet is a daunting task. (Saracino and Mori, 2020)
        
        Authenticating the identity of users before authoring access to any data or applications is critical, which makes authorisation the second step after authentication. Supporting the view that authentication and authorisation can either permit or deny access to a system are based on various criteria. In basic security service, and identity authentication is the first and the most crucial defence line for vital information and network security mechanisms in every society. (Wang et al., 2013). however, when applied together, proof to be a powerful tool to successfully manage and prevent access to sensitive data in a cyber environment.
        
        Most of the security operating systems in use today use Authentication and authorisation, which is explained based on the privileges of the user. An example is the Discretionary access control system, which  has the principle of access restriction, i.e. where the owner of the system determines who get access to the security system. (Lopez, Oppliger and Pernul, 2004)
         
        
         Mandatory Access Control is among the most critical of secure access systems, allowing access based on clearance level, where users cannot make any change to the access rights. (Hu, Kuhn and Yaga, 2017)</p> 
        Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts network access by implementing the principle of least privilege. Only those permissions should be implied by roles required to carry out the responsibilities of a job that performs an organisational function. (Lopez, Oppliger and Pernul, 2004)</p>

          <p><b>Post by Richard Meadows;Peer Response</b></p>
         <p> Hi, I agree with your post.  Firstly, the importance of authentication and authorisation is well documented.  In 2020, the most common password was still 123456 (Fruhlinger & Martin, 2021; Whitney, 2020) which shows that the message still is not getting through.  Users are not protecting themselves adequately, and systems do not provide sufficient rules for creating secure passwords.  But is the onus on the system owners or the users themselves to ensure appropriate standards when authenticating?  In many cases, the organisation will be required to put specific standards in place, however I believe that education for users, or at least uptake, is still also lacking and therefore more still needs to be done.

As you have alluded, a single mode of authentication may not be enough, and multifactor authentication (using various types) in particular is a very good method of protecting user identity.  In a digital world where almost anything can be spoofed, having multiple forms of authentication makes it exponentially more difficult to fake an identity, both when carrying out transactions and authenticating to systems.  Artificial intelligence may well be the way forward, together with attribute-based authentication which takes many factors into account during the authentication process.

In terms of authorisation, following the principle of least privilege, whereby a subject is only given the minimum permissions or privileges to do any specific task, can protect against malicious or accidental misuse, and help to limit the effects of advanced persistent threats (APT).

OWASP provides authentication and authorisation cheat sheets (OWASP, N.D.a; OWASP, N.D.b), which provides best practice ideas for system designers</p>

    <p>I agree with your post, Samuel. As Richard pointed out, the most common password is still 123456. It is clear that passwords create risk and in order for enterprises to truly protect their systems, apps, and data, all requests for access to corporate resources must include more than just a user name and password. A key tenet of the Zero Trust model is strong access management. Businesses may increase security and improve the user experience by switching to a modern Identity and Access Management solution that includes capabilities like passwordless authentication and adaptive MFA. Secure access in Zero Trust Model would look like this:
Do I know the user?
Have I seen this device before?
Does the device meet our standards?
What is our risk tolerance?
Should we grant or deny access?
Adaptive MFA provides contextual information and can determine which authentication factors apply to a particular situation. Users may be required to only accept a push notification if the situation is deemed less risky, or maybe enter an SMS code also if the situation is deemed medium risky and altogether denied if the situation is deemed high risk.</p>

<p>Hi Samuel, this is an important security feature. Authentication and Authorization require Identification features. Passwords are a means of Identification provided mostly at the application layer. Initially, password Identification would require a 4-digit numeric number but nowadays, these are considered weak. Applications like the Google password Manager can generate strong passwords with a combination of numeric, alphanumeric and special characters.

  There are also advance identification methods like biometric identification which employs users’ physical attributes like fingerprint, iris, retina, faces and voice. Advancements now incorporate multibiometric schemes for user authentication (Luis-Garcia et al., 2003). 

    Authentication and Authorization will keep advancing depending on how the identification features evolve. As you mentioned, identifying who someone is, has long passed username and passwords to more advanced Artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies. There is also the multi-factor authentication, that is, verifying an individual identity based on two to three different parameters, something you have, know and are. This can therefore be inferred that the potential in this security feature, will not be exhausted anytime soon as long as there are unique and differing attributes in life. In my opinion, the challenge may only lie on the ability to integrate new identification features into Authorization and Authentication.</p>

            <h4><b>Summary Post</b></h4>

<p>The importance of control mechanisms (how, who, and to what extent) access is granted into a network cannot be overemphasised, authenticating a user into the network, as discussed during this period. One of the weakest links in security is the user; as pointed out by Richard (Tolofari and Meadows, 2021), users need to be educated on how to create their passwords, not using conventional passwords like 12345. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), among other bodies, provides guidance on minimum criteria for a strong password, that passwords cannot be shorter than eight and should be enforced by applications (NIST SP800-63B). Maximum password length should not be set too low and more; ensure credentials change when there is compromise or password leak.

A password alone cannot guarantee the security of a network; the combination of other factors- multifactor authentication mechanisms should be implemented." The potential in multifactor authentication security features will not be exhausted anytime soon as long as there are unique and differing attributes in life. The challenge may only lie in the ability to integrate new identification features into authorisation and authentication" by Jubet., Authentication methods are based on only the possession of credentials issued to the user. The verification is performed on credentials offered at present, not considering how or when the user obtained the credentials (Hasan and Khan, 2015).

Nitin also pointed out during the discussions the importance of Adaptive Multifactor Authentication. Where contexts like location awareness, device fingerprinting or impossible velocity are added to the multifactor authentication (Stjernlof and Vries, 2020), these adaptive multifactor authentications using artificial intelligence is a step further to harden the authentication system.

 Isioma, during the discussions, highlighted that authenticating a user before authorisation; granting access to data or resources in the network is crucial, not the other way round. To what criteria and rules are the users assessed (Tolofari and Okafor -Tolofari, 2020), like

Discretionary access control: where the owner of the system determines who gets access to the system; Role-based access control, where access is granted based on the user role, Mandatory access control, which allows access based on clearance level are all among other criteria to authorise a user on what resources they can access in the network.

Authentication and authorisation are essential to network security, how they are implemented, and to what extent should depend on the asset's value. The efficiency depends on the technology used to enforce this authentication and authorisation process.</p>
